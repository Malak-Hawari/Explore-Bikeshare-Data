## Project Title
**Project1: Explore US Bikeshare Data**
***

## Description
This project explores data from three major US cities (Chicago, New York City, and Washington) to uncover insights about bike-sharing usage. The analysis involves calculating statistics on the most popular times of travel, trip duration, and user demographics. The project aims to demonstrate data manipulation, visualization, and the ability to derive meaningful conclusions from real-world datasets.

## Rubric
### Code Quality
| CRITERIA                       | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                       |
| ------------------------------ |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Functionality of code|  All code cells can be run without error.  |
|  Choice of data types and structures|  Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks.  |
|  Use of loops and conditional statements|  Loops and conditional statements are used to process the data correctly.  |
|  Use of packages|  Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks.  |
|  Use of functions|  Functions are used to reduce repetitive code.  |
|  Use of good coding practices|  Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.  |

### Script and Questions
| CRITERIA                       | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                       |
| ------------------------------ |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Solicit and handle raw user input  |  Raw input is solicited and handled correctly to guide the interactive question-answering experience; no errors are thrown when unexpected input is entered. |
|  Use descriptive statistics to answer questions about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user.  |  Descriptive statistics are correctly computed and used to answer the questions posed about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user in this manner: Script should prompt the user if they want to see 5 lines of raw data, display that data if the answer is 'yes', and continue these prompts and displays until the user says 'no'.  |
